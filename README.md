# âœ… SafeVault Security Summary

This project leveraged Copilot as a collaborative partner throughout the security hardening of SafeVault. First, Copilot was utilized to implement secure Login and Registration using ASP.NET Core Identity. Then, Copilot helped implement secure authentication using JWT token best practices. Furthermore, it helped implement authorization with robust RBAC. After implementing these core features, Copilot helped identify key vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, XSS, authentication bypass, sensitive data exposure, and CSRF. Copilot assisted by proposing defense strategies and offered implementation patterns such as ADO.NET parameterized queries and encryption, and validating the use of JWT authentication and anti-forgery tokens.

## ðŸ”’ Addressed Vulnerabilities

- **SQL Injection**
  - Parameterized queries via ADO.NET.
  - Input validation and sanitization.

- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**
  - Output escaping.
  - Server-side filtering of unsafe markup.

- **Authentication Bypass**
  - JWT authentication with middleware enforcement.
  - Token validation: issuer, expiration, claims.

- **Sensitive Data Exposure**
  - AES encryption for data-at-rest.
  - Secure transport using HTTPS and headers.

- **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**
  - Anti-forgery tokens implemented on form submissions.
  - Tokens tied to user session and validated server-side.

## ðŸ§ª Testing & Validation Efforts

- **Unit Tests**
  - Attack simulations for SQLi, XSS
  - Assertions on escape paths and error handling.

- **Manual Penetration Testing**
  - JWT tampering, cookie injection attempts.
  - Verified CSRF token enforcement across endpoints.

- **Input Validation**
  - Edge cases across forms, APIs, and database access.

- **Secure Cookie & Token Checks**
  - Ensured SameSite policies, Secure flags, and CSRF isolation.
